Database As a Service

Problem: I want to configure the database in the cloud rather than locally.

Solution: Create and easily access PostgreSQL, MYSQL, and MongoDB in the cloud.

Features:

<p>Sign up</p>
<p>Log in/log out</p>
<p>Create database</p>
<p>Choose between PostgreSQL, MYSQL, and MongoDB when creating the database</p>
<p>Choose database capacity when creating the database (free capacity is 10MB, larger capacity requires payment)</p>
<p>Limit number of databases that can be created (one database is free, more requires payment)</p>
<p>Delete database</p>
<p>View all databases</p>
<p>View database access information</p>
<p>Check database capacity</p>
