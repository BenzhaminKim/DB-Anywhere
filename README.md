# DB-Anywhere
Database As a Service

Problem: I want to configure the database in the cloud rather than locally.

Solution: Create and easily access PostgreSQL, MYSQL, and MongoDB in the cloud.

Features:

Sign up
Log in/log out
Create database
Choose between PostgreSQL, MYSQL, and MongoDB when creating the database
Choose database capacity when creating the database (free capacity is 10MB, larger capacity requires payment)
Limit number of databases that can be created (one database is free, more requires payment)
Delete database
View all databases
View database access information
Check database capacity
